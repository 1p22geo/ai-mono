**Linux** ( )[1] is a family of
[open-source](free_and_open-source_software "wikilink")
[Unix-like](Unix-like "wikilink") [operating
systems](operating_system "wikilink") based on the [Linux
kernel](Linux_kernel "wikilink"),[2] an [operating system
kernel](<kernel_(operating_system)> "wikilink") first released on
September 17, 1991, by [Linus
Torvalds](Linus_Torvalds "wikilink").[3][4][5] Linux is typically
[packaged](package_manager "wikilink") as a [Linux
distribution](Linux_distribution "wikilink") (distro), which includes
the kernel and supporting [system software](system_software "wikilink")
and [libraries](<library_(computing)> "wikilink"), many of which are
provided by the [GNU Project](GNU_Project "wikilink"). Many Linux
distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the [Free Software
Foundation](Free_Software_Foundation "wikilink") uses and recommends the
name "**GNU/Linux**" to emphasize the use and importance of
[GNU](GNU "wikilink") software in many distributions, [causing some
controversy](GNU/Linux_naming_controversy "wikilink").[6][7]

Popular Linux distributions[8][9][10] include
[Debian](Debian "wikilink"), [Fedora Linux](Fedora_Linux "wikilink"),
[Arch Linux](Arch_Linux "wikilink"), and [Ubuntu](Ubuntu "wikilink").
Commercial distributions include [Red Hat Enterprise
Linux](Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux "wikilink") and [SUSE Linux
Enterprise](SUSE_Linux_Enterprise "wikilink"). Desktop Linux
distributions include a [windowing system](windowing_system "wikilink")
such as [X11](X_Window_System "wikilink") or
[Wayland](<Wayland_(protocol)> "wikilink") and a [desktop
environment](desktop_environment "wikilink") such as
[GNOME](GNOME "wikilink") or [KDE Plasma](KDE_Plasma "wikilink").
Distributions intended for [servers](<server_(computing)> "wikilink") may
not have a [graphical user
interface](graphical_user_interface "wikilink") at all, or include a
[solution stack](solution_stack "wikilink") such as
[LAMP](<LAMP_(software_bundle)> "wikilink"). Because Linux is freely
redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.[11]

Linux was originally developed for [personal
computers](personal_computer "wikilink") based on the [Intel
x86](Intel_x86 "wikilink") architecture, but has since been
[ported](porting "wikilink") to more
[platforms](computer_hardware_platforms "wikilink") than any other
operating system.[12] Because of the dominance of Linux-based
[Android](<Android_(operating_system)> "wikilink") on
[smartphones](smartphone "wikilink"), Linux, including Android, has the
[largest](Usage_share_of_operating_systems "wikilink") installed base of
all [general-purpose operating
systems](general-purpose_operating_system "wikilink") .[13][14][15]
Linux is, , used by around 4 percent of [desktop
computers](desktop_computer "wikilink"),[16] the
[Chromebook](Chromebook "wikilink"), which runs the Linux kernel-based
[ChromeOS](ChromeOS "wikilink"), dominates the US
[K–12](K–12 "wikilink") education market and represents nearly 20
percent of sub-$300 [notebook](Laptop "wikilink") sales in the US.[17]
Linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the top
one million web servers' operating systems are Linux),[18] leads other
[big iron](<Big_iron_(computing)> "wikilink") systems such as [mainframe
computers](mainframe_computer "wikilink"), and is used on all of the
[world's 500 fastest supercomputers](TOP500 "wikilink") (, having
gradually displaced all competitors).[19][20][21]

Linux also runs on [embedded systems](embedded_system "wikilink"), i.e.,
devices whose operating system is typically built into the
[firmware](firmware "wikilink") and is highly tailored to the system.
This includes [routers](<router_(computing)> "wikilink"),
[automation](automation "wikilink") controls, [smart home
devices](smart_home_technology "wikilink"), [video game
consoles](video_game_console "wikilink"),[22]
[televisions](television "wikilink") (Samsung and LG [Smart
TVs](Smart_TV "wikilink")),[23][24][25]
[automobiles](automobiles "wikilink") (Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz,
Hyundai, and Toyota),[26] and [spacecraft](spacecraft "wikilink")
([Falcon 9](Falcon_9 "wikilink") rocket,
[Dragon](SpaceX_Dragon_2 "wikilink") crew capsule, and the
[_Perseverance_](<Perseverance_(rover)> "wikilink") rover).[27][28]

Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source
[software](software "wikilink") collaboration. The [source
code](source_code "wikilink") may be used, modified, and distributed
commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms of its
respective licenses, such as the [GNU General Public
License](GNU_General_Public_License "wikilink") (GPL). The Linux kernel,
for example, is licensed under the GPLv2, with an exception for [system
calls](system_call "wikilink") that allows code that calls the kernel
via system calls not to be licensed under the GPL.[29][30][31]

## History

### Precursors

<figure>

title="Linus Torvalds, principal author of the Linux kernel " />
<figcaption>Linus Torvalds, principal author of the Linux kernel
</figcaption>
</figure>

The [Unix](Unix "wikilink") operating system was conceived and
implemented in 1969, at [AT&T](AT&T_Corporation "wikilink")'s [Bell
Labs](Bell_Labs "wikilink"), in the United States by [Ken
Thompson](Ken_Thompson "wikilink"), [Dennis
Ritchie](Dennis_Ritchie "wikilink"), [Douglas
McIlroy](Douglas_McIlroy "wikilink"), and [Joe
Ossanna](Joe_Ossanna "wikilink").[32] First released in 1971, Unix was
written entirely in [assembly language](assembly_language "wikilink"),
as was common practice at the time. In 1973, in a key pioneering
approach, it was rewritten in the
[C](<C_(programming_language)> "wikilink") programming language by Dennis
Ritchie (except for some hardware and I/O routines). The availability of
a [high-level language](high-level_language "wikilink") implementation
of Unix made its [porting](porting "wikilink") to different computer
platforms easier.[33]

Due to an earlier [antitrust case](antitrust_case "wikilink") forbidding
it from entering the computer business, AT&T licensed the operating
system's [source code](source_code "wikilink") as a [trade
secret](trade_secret "wikilink") to anyone who asked. As a result, Unix
grew quickly and became widely adopted by [academic
institutions](academic_institution "wikilink") and businesses. In 1984,
[AT&T divested itself](Breakup_of_the_Bell_System "wikilink") of its
[regional operating
companies](Regional_Bell_Operating_Company "wikilink"), and was released
from its obligation not to enter the computer business; freed of that
obligation, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a
[proprietary](Proprietary_software "wikilink") product, where users were
not legally allowed to modify it.[34][35]

[Onyx Systems](Onyx_Systems "wikilink") began selling early
microcomputer-based Unix workstations in 1980. Later, [Sun
Microsystems](Sun_Microsystems "wikilink"), founded as a spin-off of a
student project at [Stanford
University](Stanford_University "wikilink"), also began selling
Unix-based desktop workstations in 1982. While Sun workstations did not
use commodity PC hardware, for which Linux was later originally
developed, it represented the first successful commercial attempt at
distributing a primarily single-user microcomputer that ran a Unix
operating system.[36][37]

With Unix increasingly "locked in" as a proprietary product, the [GNU
Project](GNU_Project "wikilink"), started in 1983 by [Richard
Stallman](Richard_Stallman "wikilink"), had the goal of creating a
"complete Unix-compatible software system" composed entirely of [free
software](free_software "wikilink"). Work began in 1984.[38] Later, in
1985, Stallman started the [Free Software
Foundation](Free_Software_Foundation "wikilink") and wrote the [GNU
General Public License](GNU_General_Public_License "wikilink") (GNU GPL)
in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an
operating system (such as libraries, [compilers](compiler "wikilink"),
[text editors](text_editor "wikilink"), a [command-line
shell](<Shell_(computing)#Command-line_shells> "wikilink"), and a
[windowing system](windowing_system "wikilink")) were completed,
although low-level elements such as [device
drivers](device_driver "wikilink"),
[daemons](<daemon_(computing)> "wikilink"), and the
[kernel](<kernel_(operating_system)> "wikilink"), called [GNU
Hurd](GNU_Hurd "wikilink"), were stalled and incomplete.[39]

[MINIX](MINIX "wikilink") was created by [Andrew S.
Tanenbaum](Andrew_S._Tanenbaum "wikilink"), a [computer
science](computer_science "wikilink") professor, and released in 1987 as
a minimal Unix-like operating system targeted at students and others who
wanted to learn operating system principles. Although the complete
source code of MINIX was freely available, the licensing terms prevented
it from being [free software](free_software "wikilink") until the
licensing changed in April 2000.[40]

Although not released until 1992, due to [legal
complications](UNIX_System_Laboratories,_Inc._v._Berkeley_Software_Design,_Inc. "wikilink"),
the development of [386BSD](386BSD "wikilink"), from which
[NetBSD](NetBSD "wikilink"), [OpenBSD](OpenBSD "wikilink") and
[FreeBSD](FreeBSD "wikilink") descended, predated that of Linux. Linus
Torvalds has stated on separate occasions that if the [GNU
kernel](GNU_kernel "wikilink") or 386BSD had been available at the time
(1991), he probably would not have created Linux.[41][42]

### Creation

While attending the [University of
Helsinki](University_of_Helsinki "wikilink") in the fall of 1990,
Torvalds enrolled in a Unix course.[43] The course used a
[MicroVAX](MicroVAX "wikilink") minicomputer running
[Ultrix](Ultrix "wikilink"), and one of the required texts was
_[Operating Systems: Design and
Implementation](Operating_Systems:_Design_and_Implementation "wikilink")_
by [Andrew S. Tanenbaum](Andrew_S._Tanenbaum "wikilink"). This textbook
included a copy of Tanenbaum's [MINIX](MINIX "wikilink") operating
system. It was with this course that Torvalds first became exposed to
Unix. In 1991, he became curious about operating systems.[44] Frustrated
by the licensing of MINIX, which at the time limited it to educational
use only,[45] he began to work on his operating system kernel, which
eventually became the Linux kernel.

On July 3, 1991, to implement Unix [system
calls](system_call "wikilink"), Linus Torvalds attempted unsuccessfully
to obtain a digital copy of the [POSIX](POSIX "wikilink") standards
[documentation](Software_documentation "wikilink") with a request to the
_comp.os.minix_ [newsgroup](Usenet_newsgroup "wikilink").[46] After not
finding the POSIX documentation, Torvalds initially resorted to
determining system calls from [SunOS](SunOS "wikilink") documentation
owned by the university for use in operating its [Sun
Microsystems](Sun_Microsystems "wikilink") server. He also learned some
system calls from Tanenbaum's MINIX text.

Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on MINIX and
applications written for MINIX were also used on Linux. Later, Linux
matured and further Linux kernel development took place on Linux
systems.[47] GNU applications also replaced all MINIX components,
because it was advantageous to use the freely available code from the
GNU Project with the fledgling operating system; code licensed under the
GNU GPL can be reused in other computer programs as long as they also
are released under the same or a compatible license. Torvalds initiated
a switch from his original license, which prohibited commercial
redistribution, to the GNU GPL.[48] Developers worked to integrate GNU
components with the Linux kernel, creating a fully functional and free
operating system.[49]

### Naming

<figure>
<img src="Linux_0_12.jpg"
title="5.25-inch floppy disks holding a very early version of Linux" />
<figcaption>5.25-inch <a href="floppy_disk" title="wikilink">floppy
disks</a> holding a very early version of Linux</figcaption>
</figure>

Linus Torvalds had wanted to call his invention "**Freax**", a
[portmanteau](portmanteau "wikilink") of "free", "freak", and "x" (as an
allusion to Unix). During the start of his work on the system, some of
the project's [makefiles](makefile "wikilink") included the name "Freax"
for about half a year. Initially, Torvalds considered the name "Linux"
but dismissed it as too egotistical.[50]

To facilitate development, the files were uploaded to the [FTP
server](File_Transfer_Protocol "wikilink") (`ftp.funet.fi`) of
[FUNET](FUNET "wikilink") in September 1991. Ari Lemmke, Torvalds'
coworker at the [Helsinki University of
Technology](Helsinki_University_of_Technology "wikilink") (HUT) who was
one of the volunteer administrators for the FTP server at the time, did
not think that "Freax" was a good name, so he named the project "Linux"
on the server without consulting Torvalds.[51] Later, however, Torvalds
consented to "Linux".

According to a [newsgroup](Usenet_newsgroup "wikilink") post by
Torvalds,[52] the word "Linux" should be pronounced ( ) with a short 'i'
as in 'print' and 'u' as in 'put'. To further demonstrate how the word
"Linux" should be pronounced, he included an audio guide with the kernel
source code.[53] However, in this recording, he pronounces Linux as \*\*
() with a short but [close front unrounded
vowel](close_front_unrounded_vowel "wikilink"), instead of a [near-close
near-front unrounded
vowel](near-close_near-front_unrounded_vowel "wikilink") as in his
newsgroup post.

### Commercial and popular uptake

![[Ubuntu](Ubuntu_(operating_system) "wikilink"), a popular Linux
distribution](Ubuntu_23.10_Mantic_Minotaur_Desktop_English.png "Ubuntu, a popular Linux distribution")
![[Nexus 5X](Nexus_5X "wikilink") running
[Android](Android_(operating_system) "wikilink")
](<Nexus_5X_(White).jpg> "Nexus 5X running Android ")

The adoption of Linux in production environments, rather than being used
only by hobbyists, started to take off first in the mid-1990s in the
supercomputing community, where organizations such as
[NASA](NASA "wikilink") started to replace their increasingly expensive
machines with [clusters](computer_cluster "wikilink") of inexpensive
commodity computers running Linux. Commercial use began when
[Dell](Dell "wikilink") and [IBM](IBM "wikilink"), followed by
[Hewlett-Packard](Hewlett-Packard "wikilink"), started offering Linux
support to escape [Microsoft](Microsoft "wikilink")'s monopoly in the
desktop operating system market.[54]

Today, Linux systems are used throughout computing, from [embedded
systems](embedded_system "wikilink") to virtually all
[supercomputers](supercomputer "wikilink"),[55][56] and have secured a
place in server installations such as the popular
[LAMP](<LAMP_(software_bundle)> "wikilink") application stack. The use of
Linux distributions in home and enterprise desktops has been
growing.[57][58][59][60][61][62][63] Linux distributions have also
become popular in the [netbook](netbook "wikilink") market, with many
devices shipping with customized Linux distributions installed, and
Google releasing their own [ChromeOS](ChromeOS "wikilink") designed for
netbooks.

Linux's greatest success in the consumer market is perhaps the mobile
device market, with Android being the dominant operating system on
[smartphones](smartphone "wikilink") and very popular on
[tablets](Tablet_computer "wikilink") and, more recently, on
[wearables](wearable_technology "wikilink"). [Linux
gaming](Linux_gaming "wikilink") is also on the rise with
[Valve](Valve_Corporation "wikilink") showing its support for Linux and
rolling out [SteamOS](SteamOS "wikilink"), its own gaming-oriented Linux
distribution, which was later implemented in their [Steam
Deck](Steam_Deck "wikilink") platform. Linux distributions have also
gained popularity with various local and national governments, such as
the federal government of [Brazil](Brazil "wikilink").[64]

### Current development

![[In-flight entertainment](In-flight_entertainment "wikilink") system
booting up displaying the Linux
logo](In_flight_system_Linux_bootup_flat.jpg "In-flight entertainment system booting up displaying the Linux logo")
Linus Torvalds is the lead maintainer for the Linux kernel and guides
its development, while [Greg
Kroah-Hartman](Greg_Kroah-Hartman "wikilink") is the lead maintainer for
the stable branch.[65] [Zoë Kooyman](Zoë_Kooyman "wikilink") is the
executive director of the Free Software Foundation,[66] which in turn
supports the GNU components.[67] Finally, individuals and corporations
develop third-party non-GNU components. These third-party components
comprise a vast body of work and may include both kernel modules and
user applications and libraries.

Linux vendors and communities combine and distribute the kernel, GNU
components, and non-GNU components, with additional [package
management](package_management "wikilink") software in the form of Linux
distributions.

## Design

Many developers of [open-source](open_source "wikilink") software agree
that the Linux kernel was not designed but rather
[evolved](evolution "wikilink") through [natural
selection](natural_selection "wikilink"). Torvalds considers that
although the design of Unix served as a scaffolding, "Linux grew with a
lot of mutations – and because the mutations were less than random, they
were faster and more directed than [alpha-particles in
DNA](Mutation#Induced_mutation "wikilink")."[68] [Eric S.
Raymond](Eric_S._Raymond "wikilink") considers Linux's revolutionary
aspects to be social, not technical: before Linux, complex software was
designed carefully by small groups, but "Linux evolved in a completely
different way. From nearly the beginning, it was rather casually hacked
on by huge numbers of volunteers coordinating only through the Internet.
Quality was maintained not by rigid standards or autocracy but by the
naively simple strategy of releasing every week and getting feedback
from hundreds of users within days, creating a sort of rapid Darwinian
selection on the mutations introduced by developers."[69] [Bryan
Cantrill](Bryan_Cantrill "wikilink"), an engineer of a competing OS,
agrees that "Linux wasn't designed, it evolved", but considers this to
be a limitation, proposing that some features, especially those related
to security,[70] cannot be evolved into, "this is not a biological
system at the end of the day, it's a software system."[71]

A Linux-based system is a modular Unix-like operating system, deriving
much of its basic design from principles established in Unix during the
1970s and 1980s. Such a system uses a [monolithic
kernel](monolithic_kernel "wikilink"), the Linux kernel, which handles
process control, networking, access to the
[peripherals](peripheral "wikilink"), and [file
systems](file_system "wikilink"). [Device
drivers](Device_driver "wikilink") are either integrated directly with
the kernel or added as modules that are loaded while the system is
running.[72]

The GNU [userland](user_space_and_kernel_space "wikilink") is a key part
of most systems based on the Linux kernel, with Android being the
notable exception. The [GNU C library](glibc "wikilink"), an
implementation of the [C standard
library](C_standard_library "wikilink"), works as a wrapper for the
system calls of the Linux kernel necessary to the kernel-userspace
interface, the [toolchain](GNU_toolchain "wikilink") is a broad
collection of programming tools vital to Linux development (including
the [compilers](GNU_Compiler_Collection "wikilink") used to build the
Linux kernel itself), and the [coreutils](GNU_Core_Utilities "wikilink")
implement many basic [Unix tools](List_of_Unix_commands "wikilink"). The
GNU Project also develops [Bash](<Bash_(Unix_shell)> "wikilink"), a
popular [CLI](Command-line_interface "wikilink") shell. The [graphical
user interface](graphical_user_interface "wikilink") (or GUI) used by
most Linux systems is built on top of an implementation of the [X Window
System](X_Window_System "wikilink").[73] More recently, the Linux
community has sought to advance to
[Wayland](<Wayland_(protocol)> "wikilink") as the new display server
protocol, in place of X11. Many other open-source software projects
contribute to Linux systems.

Installed components of a Linux system include the following:[74][75]

- A [bootloader](bootloader "wikilink"), for example [GNU
  GRUB](GNU_GRUB "wikilink"), [LILO](<LILO_(bootloader)> "wikilink"),
  [SYSLINUX](SYSLINUX "wikilink") or
  [systemd-boot](systemd-boot "wikilink"). This is a program that
  loads the Linux kernel into the computer's [main
  memory](main_memory "wikilink"), by being executed by the computer
  when it is turned on and after the [firmware](firmware "wikilink")
  initialization is performed.
- An [init](init "wikilink") program, such as the traditional
  [sysvinit](sysvinit "wikilink") and the newer
  [systemd](systemd "wikilink"), [OpenRC](OpenRC "wikilink") and
  [Upstart](<Upstart_(software)> "wikilink"). This is the first
  [process](<Process_(computing)> "wikilink") launched by the Linux
  kernel, and is at the root of the process tree. It starts processes
  such as system services and login prompts (whether graphical or in
  terminal mode).
- [Software libraries](<Library_(computing)> "wikilink"), which contain
  code that can be used by running processes. On Linux systems using
  [ELF](Executable_and_Linkable_Format "wikilink")-format executable
  files, the [dynamic linker](dynamic_linker "wikilink") that manages
  the use of dynamic libraries is known as
  [ld-linux.so](ld-linux.so "wikilink"). If the system is set up for
  the user to compile software themselves, [header
  files](header_file "wikilink") will also be included to describe the
  [programming interface](API "wikilink") of installed libraries.
  Besides the most commonly used software library on Linux systems,
  the [GNU C Library](GNU_C_Library "wikilink") (glibc), there are
  numerous other libraries, such as
  [SDL](Simple_DirectMedia_Layer "wikilink") and
  [Mesa](<Mesa_(computer_graphics)> "wikilink").
  - The [C standard library](C_standard_library "wikilink") is the
    library necessary to run programs written in
    [C](<C_(programming_language)> "wikilink") on a computer system,
    with the GNU C Library being the standard. It provides an
    implementation of the POSIX API, as well as extensions to that
    API. For embedded systems, alternatives such as
    [musl](musl "wikilink"), [EGLIBC](EGLIBC "wikilink") (a glibc
    fork once used by Debian) and [uClibc](uClibc "wikilink") (which
    was designed for [uClinux](uClinux "wikilink")) have been
    developed, although the last two are no longer maintained.
    Android uses its own C library,
    [Bionic](<Bionic_(software)> "wikilink"). However, musl can
    additionally be used as a replacement for glibc on desktop and
    laptop systems, as seen on certain Linux distributions like
    [Void Linux](Void_Linux "wikilink").
- Basic Unix commands, with GNU coreutils being the standard
  implementation. Alternatives exist for embedded systems, such as the
  copyleft [BusyBox](BusyBox "wikilink"), and the BSD-licensed
  [Toybox](Toybox "wikilink").
- [Widget toolkits](Widget_toolkit "wikilink") are the libraries used
  to build [graphical user
  interfaces](graphical_user_interface "wikilink") (GUIs) for software
  applications. Numerous widget toolkits are available, including
  [GTK](GTK "wikilink") and [Clutter](<Clutter_(software)> "wikilink")
  developed by the [GNOME Project](GNOME_Project "wikilink"),
  [Qt](<Qt_(software)> "wikilink") developed by the [Qt
  Project](Qt_Project "wikilink") and led by [The Qt
  Company](The_Qt_Company "wikilink"), and [Enlightenment Foundation
  Libraries](Enlightenment_Foundation_Libraries "wikilink") (EFL)
  developed primarily by the
  [Enlightenment](<Enlightenment_(software)> "wikilink") team.
- A [package management system](package_manager "wikilink"), such as
  [dpkg](dpkg "wikilink") and [RPM](RPM_Package_Manager "wikilink").
  Alternatively packages can be compiled from binary or source
  [tarballs](<Tar_(computing)> "wikilink").
- User interface programs such as command shells or windowing
  environments.

### User interface

The [user interface](user_interface "wikilink"), also known as the
[shell](<shell_(computing)> "wikilink"), is either a command-line
interface (CLI), a graphical user interface (GUI), or controls attached
to the associated hardware, which is common for embedded systems. For
desktop systems, the default user interface is usually graphical,
although the CLI is commonly available through [terminal
emulator](terminal_emulator "wikilink") windows or on a separate
[virtual console](virtual_console "wikilink").

CLI shells are text-based user interfaces, which use text for both input
and output. The dominant shell used in Linux is the [Bourne-Again
Shell](<bash_(Unix_shell)> "wikilink") (bash), originally developed for
the GNU Project. Most low-level Linux components, including various
parts of the [userland](<Userland_(computing)> "wikilink"), use the CLI
exclusively. The CLI is particularly suited for automation of repetitive
or delayed tasks and provides very simple [inter-process
communication](inter-process_communication "wikilink").

On desktop systems, the most popular user interfaces are the [GUI
shells](GUI_shell "wikilink"), packaged together with extensive desktop
environments, such as [KDE Plasma](KDE_Plasma_5 "wikilink"),
[GNOME](GNOME "wikilink"),
[MATE](<MATE_(desktop_environment)> "wikilink"),
[Cinnamon](<Cinnamon_(desktop_environment)> "wikilink"),
[LXDE](LXDE "wikilink"), [Pantheon](Elementary_OS "wikilink"), and
[Xfce](Xfce "wikilink"), though a variety of additional user interfaces
exist. Most popular user interfaces are based on the X Window System,
often simply called "X". It provides [network
transparency](network_transparency "wikilink") and permits a graphical
application running on one system to be displayed on another where a
user may interact with the application; however, certain extensions of
the X Window System are not capable of working over the network.[76]
Several X display servers exist, with the reference implementation,
[X.Org Server](X.Org_Server "wikilink"), being the most popular.

Server distributions might provide a command-line interface for
developers and administrators, but provide a custom interface for
end-users, designed for the use case of the system. This custom
interface is accessed through a client that resides on another system,
not necessarily Linux-based.

Several types of [window managers](window_manager "wikilink") exist for
X11, including [tiling](Tiling_window_manager "wikilink"),
[dynamic](Dynamic_window_manager "wikilink"),
[stacking](stacking_window_manager "wikilink"), and
[compositing](compositing_window_manager "wikilink"). Window managers
provide means to control the placement and appearance of individual
application windows, and interact with the X Window System. Simpler [X
window managers](X_window_manager "wikilink") such as
[dwm](dwm "wikilink"), [ratpoison](ratpoison "wikilink"), or
[i3wm](<i3_(window_manager)> "wikilink") provide a
[minimalist](<Minimalism_(computing)> "wikilink") functionality, while
more elaborate window managers such as [FVWM](FVWM "wikilink"),
[Enlightenment](<Enlightenment_(software)> "wikilink"), or [Window
Maker](Window_Maker "wikilink") provide more features such as a built-in
[taskbar](taskbar "wikilink") and
[themes](<theme_(computing)> "wikilink"), but are still lightweight when
compared to desktop environments. Desktop environments include window
managers as part of their standard installations, such as
[Mutter](<Mutter_(software)> "wikilink") (GNOME), [KWin](KWin "wikilink")
(KDE), or [Xfwm](Xfwm "wikilink") (xfce), although users may choose to
use a different window manager if preferred.

Wayland is a display server protocol intended as a replacement for the
X11 protocol; , it has received relatively wide adoption.[77] Unlike
X11, Wayland does not need an external window manager and compositing
manager. Therefore, a Wayland compositor takes the role of the display
server, window manager, and compositing manager. Weston is the reference
implementation of Wayland, while GNOME's Mutter and KDE's KWin are being
ported to Wayland as standalone display servers. Enlightenment has
already been successfully ported since version 19.[78]

### Video input infrastructure

Linux currently has two modern kernel-userspace APIs for handling video
input devices: [V4L2](Video4Linux "wikilink") API for video streams and
radio, and [DVB](DVB "wikilink") API for digital TV reception.[79]

Due to the complexity and diversity of different devices, and due to the
large number of formats and standards handled by those APIs, this
infrastructure needs to evolve to better fit other devices. Also, a good
userspace device library is the key to the success of having userspace
applications to be able to work with all formats supported by those
devices.[80][81]

## Development

[thumb\|upright=2.25\|Simplified history of Unix-like operating systems.
Linux shares similar architecture and concepts (as part of the
[POSIX](POSIX "wikilink") standard) but does not share non-free source
code with the original [Unix](Unix "wikilink") or
MINIX.](File:Unix_timeline.en.svg "wikilink")

The primary difference between Linux and many other popular contemporary
operating systems is that the Linux kernel and other components are free
and open-source software. Linux is not the only such operating system,
although it is by far the most widely used.[82] Some
[free](free_software_license "wikilink") and [open-source software
licenses](open-source_license "wikilink") are based on the principle of
[copyleft](copyleft "wikilink"), a kind of reciprocity: any work derived
from a copyleft piece of software must also be copyleft itself. The most
common free software license, the GNU General Public License (GPL), is a
form of copyleft and is used for the Linux kernel and many of the
components from the GNU Project.[83]

Linux-based distributions are intended by developers for
[interoperability](interoperability "wikilink") with other operating
systems and established computing standards. Linux systems adhere to
POSIX,[84] [SUS](Single_UNIX_Specification "wikilink"),[85]
[LSB](Linux_Standard_Base "wikilink"),
[ISO](International_Organization_for_Standardization "wikilink"), and
[ANSI](American_National_Standards_Institute "wikilink") standards where
possible, although to date only one Linux distribution has been POSIX.1
certified, Linux-FT.[86][87]

Free software projects, although developed through
[collaboration](collaboration "wikilink"), are often produced
independently of each other. The fact that the software licenses
explicitly permit redistribution, however, provides a basis for
larger-scale projects that collect the software produced by stand-alone
projects and make it available all at once in the form of a Linux
distribution.

Many Linux distributions manage a remote collection of system software
and application software packages available for download and
installation through a network connection. This allows users to adapt
the operating system to their specific needs. Distributions are
maintained by individuals, loose-knit teams, volunteer organizations,
and commercial entities. A distribution is responsible for the default
configuration of the installed Linux kernel, general system security,
and more generally integration of the different software packages into a
coherent whole. Distributions typically use a package manager such as
[apt](<APT_(software)> "wikilink"), [yum](<yum_(software)> "wikilink"),
[zypper](ZYpp "wikilink"), [pacman](<Pacman_(package_manager)> "wikilink")
or [portage](<Portage_(software)> "wikilink") to install, remove, and
update all of a system's software from one central location.[88]

### Community

A distribution is largely driven by its developer and user communities.
Some vendors develop and fund their distributions on a volunteer basis,
[Debian](Debian "wikilink") being a well-known example. Others maintain
a community version of their commercial distributions, as [Red
Hat](Red_Hat "wikilink") does with [Fedora](Fedora_Linux "wikilink"),
and [SUSE](SUSE_S.A. "wikilink") does with
[openSUSE](openSUSE "wikilink").[89][90]

In many cities and regions, local associations known as [Linux User
Groups](Linux_User_Group "wikilink") (LUGs) seek to promote their
preferred distribution and by extension free software. They hold
meetings and provide free demonstrations, training, technical support,
and operating system installation to new users. Many Internet
communities also provide support to Linux users and developers. Most
distributions and free software / open-source projects have
[IRC](Internet_Relay_Chat "wikilink") chatrooms or
[newsgroups](newsgroup "wikilink"). [Online
forums](Internet_forum "wikilink") are another means of support, with
notable examples being
[LinuxQuestions.org](LinuxQuestions.org "wikilink") and the various
distribution-specific support and community forums, such as ones for
[Ubuntu](Ubuntu "wikilink"), Fedora, and
[Gentoo](Gentoo_Linux "wikilink"). Linux distributions host [mailing
lists](mailing_list "wikilink"); commonly there will be a specific topic
such as usage or development for a given list.

There are several technology websites with a Linux focus. Print
magazines on Linux often bundle [cover disks](cover_disk "wikilink")
that carry software or even complete Linux distributions.[91][92]

Although Linux distributions are generally available without charge,
several large corporations sell, support, and contribute to the
development of the components of the system and free software. An
analysis of the Linux kernel in 2017 showed that well over 85% of the
code was developed by programmers who are being paid for their work,
leaving about 8.2% to unpaid developers and 4.1% unclassified.[93] Some
of the major corporations that provide contributions include
[Intel](Intel "wikilink"), [Samsung](Samsung "wikilink"),
[Google](Google "wikilink"), [AMD](AMD "wikilink"),
[Oracle](Oracle_Corporation "wikilink"), and
[Facebook](Facebook "wikilink").[94] Several corporations, notably Red
Hat, [Canonical](<Canonical_(company)> "wikilink"), and
[SUSE](SUSE_S.A. "wikilink") have built a significant business around
Linux distributions.

The [free software licenses](free_software_license "wikilink"), on which
the various software packages of a distribution built on the Linux
kernel are based, explicitly accommodate and encourage
commercialization; the relationship between a Linux distribution as a
whole and individual vendors may be seen as
[symbiotic](symbiosis "wikilink"). One common [business
model](business_model "wikilink") of commercial suppliers is charging
for support, especially for business users. A number of companies also
offer a specialized business version of their distribution, which adds
proprietary support packages and tools to administer higher numbers of
installations or to simplify administrative tasks.

Another business model is to give away the software to sell hardware.
This used to be the norm in the computer industry, with operating
systems such as [CP/M](CP/M "wikilink"), [Apple
DOS](Apple_DOS "wikilink"), and versions of the [classic Mac
OS](classic_Mac_OS "wikilink") before 7.6 freely copyable (but not
modifiable). As computer hardware standardized throughout the 1980s, it
became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this
tactic, as the OS would run on any manufacturer's computer that shared
the same architecture.

### Programming on Linux

Most [programming languages](programming_language "wikilink") support
Linux either directly or through third-party community based
[ports](Porting "wikilink").[95] The original development tools used for
building both Linux applications and operating system programs are found
within the [GNU toolchain](GNU_toolchain "wikilink"), which includes the
[GNU Compiler Collection](GNU_Compiler_Collection "wikilink") (GCC) and
the [GNU Build System](GNU_Build_System "wikilink"). Amongst others, GCC
provides compilers for [Ada](<Ada_(programming_language)> "wikilink"), C,
[C++](C++ "wikilink"), [Go](<Go_(programming_language)> "wikilink") and
[Fortran](Fortran "wikilink"). Many programming languages have a
cross-platform reference implementation that supports Linux, for example
[PHP](PHP "wikilink"), [Perl](Perl "wikilink"),
[Ruby](<Ruby_(programming_language)> "wikilink"),
[Python](<Python_(programming_language)> "wikilink"),
[Java](<Java_(programming_language)> "wikilink"),
[Go](<Go_(programming_language)> "wikilink"),
[Rust](<Rust_(programming_language)> "wikilink") and
[Haskell](Haskell "wikilink"). First released in 2003, the
[LLVM](LLVM "wikilink") project provides an alternative cross-platform
open-source compiler for many languages.
[Proprietary](Proprietary_software "wikilink") compilers for Linux
include the [Intel C++ Compiler](Intel_C++_Compiler "wikilink"), [Sun
Studio](<Sun_Studio_(software)> "wikilink"), and [IBM XL C/C++
Compiler](IBM_XL_C/C++_Compilers "wikilink"). [BASIC](BASIC "wikilink")
is available in [procedural](procedural_programming "wikilink") form
from [QB64](QB64 "wikilink"), [PureBasic](PureBasic "wikilink"),
[Yabasic](Yabasic "wikilink"), [GLBasic](GLBasic "wikilink"),
[Basic4GL](Basic4GL "wikilink"), [XBasic](XBasic "wikilink"),
[wxBasic](wxBasic "wikilink"), [SdlBasic](SdlBasic "wikilink"), and
[Basic-256](Basic-256 "wikilink"), as well as [object
oriented](object_oriented_programming "wikilink") through
[Gambas](Gambas "wikilink"), [FreeBASIC](FreeBASIC "wikilink"),
[B4X](B4X "wikilink"), [Basic for Qt](Basic_for_Qt "wikilink"), [Phoenix
Object Basic](Phoenix_Object_Basic "wikilink"), [NS
Basic](NS_Basic "wikilink"), [ProvideX](ProvideX "wikilink"), [Chipmunk
Basic](Chipmunk_Basic "wikilink"), [RapidQ](RapidQ "wikilink") and
[Xojo](Xojo "wikilink").
[Pascal](<Pascal_(programming_language)> "wikilink") is implemented
through [GNU Pascal](GNU_Pascal "wikilink"), [Free
Pascal](Free_Pascal "wikilink"), and [Virtual
Pascal](Virtual_Pascal "wikilink"), as well as graphically via
[Lazarus](<Lazarus_(software)> "wikilink"),
[PascalABC.NET](PascalABC.NET "wikilink"), or
[Delphi](<Delphi_(software)> "wikilink") using
[FireMonkey](FireMonkey "wikilink") (previously through [Borland
Kylix](Borland_Kylix "wikilink")).

A common feature of Unix-like systems, Linux includes traditional
specific-purpose programming languages targeted at
[scripting](scripting_language "wikilink"), text processing and system
configuration and management in general. Linux distributions support
[shell scripts](shell_script "wikilink"), [awk](AWK "wikilink"),
[sed](sed "wikilink") and [make](<make_(software)> "wikilink"). Many
programs also have an embedded programming language to support
configuring or programming themselves. For example, [regular
expressions](regular_expression "wikilink") are supported in programs
like [grep](grep "wikilink") and [locate](<locate_(Unix)> "wikilink"), the
traditional Unix message transfer agent [Sendmail](Sendmail "wikilink")
contains its own [Turing complete](Turing_completeness "wikilink")
scripting system, and the advanced text editor [GNU
Emacs](GNU_Emacs "wikilink") is built around a general purpose
[Lisp](Emacs_Lisp "wikilink") interpreter.

Most distributions also include support for [PHP](PHP "wikilink"),
[Perl](Perl "wikilink"), [Ruby](<Ruby_(programming_language)> "wikilink"),
[Python](<Python_(programming_language)> "wikilink") and other [dynamic
languages](dynamic_programming_language "wikilink"). While not as
common, Linux also supports
[C#](<C_Sharp_(programming_language)> "wikilink") and other
[CLI](Common_Language_Infrastructure "wikilink")
[languages](List_of_CLI_languages "wikilink") (via
[Mono](<Mono_(software)> "wikilink")),
[Vala](<Vala_(programming_language)> "wikilink"), and
[Scheme](<Scheme_(programming_language)> "wikilink"). [Guile
Scheme](<Guile_(programming_language)> "wikilink") acts as an [extension
language](scripting_language "wikilink") targeting the GNU system
utilities, seeking to make the conventionally small,
[static](static_typing "wikilink"), compiled C programs of [Unix
design](Unix_philosophy "wikilink") rapidly and dynamically extensible
via an elegant, [functional](functional_programming "wikilink")
high-level scripting system; many GNU programs can be compiled with
optional Guile [bindings](language_binding "wikilink") to this end. A
number of [Java virtual machines](Java_virtual_machine "wikilink") and
development kits run on Linux, including the original Sun Microsystems
JVM ([HotSpot](<HotSpot_(virtual_machine)> "wikilink")), and IBM's J2SE
RE, as well as many open-source projects like [Kaffe](Kaffe "wikilink")
and [Jikes RVM](Jikes_RVM "wikilink");
[Kotlin](<Kotlin_(programming_language)> "wikilink"),
[Scala](<Scala_(programming_language)> "wikilink"),
[Groovy](Apache_Groovy "wikilink") and other [JVM
languages](List_of_JVM_languages "wikilink") are also available.

GNOME and [KDE](KDE "wikilink") are popular desktop environments and
provide a framework for developing applications. These projects are
based on the [GTK](GTK "wikilink") and [Qt](<Qt_(toolkit)> "wikilink")
widget toolkits, respectively, which can also be used independently of
the larger framework. Both support a wide variety of languages. There
are [a
number](:Category:Linux_integrated_development_environments "wikilink")
of [Integrated development
environments](Integrated_development_environment "wikilink") available
including [Anjuta](Anjuta "wikilink"),
[Code::Blocks](Code::Blocks "wikilink"),
[CodeLite](CodeLite "wikilink"),
[Eclipse](<Eclipse_(software)> "wikilink"), [Geany](Geany "wikilink"),
[ActiveState Komodo](ActiveState_Komodo "wikilink"),
[KDevelop](KDevelop "wikilink"),
[Lazarus](<Lazarus_(software)> "wikilink"),
[MonoDevelop](MonoDevelop "wikilink"), [NetBeans](NetBeans "wikilink"),
and [Qt Creator](Qt_Creator "wikilink"), while the long-established
editors [Vim](<Vim_(text_editor)> "wikilink"), [nano](GNU_nano "wikilink")
and [Emacs](Emacs "wikilink") remain popular.[96]

## Hardware support

[thumb\|right\|upright=2.25\|Linux is ubiquitously found on various
types of hardware.](File:Linux_kernel_ubiquity.svg "wikilink")

The Linux kernel is a widely ported operating system kernel, available
for devices ranging from mobile phones to supercomputers; it runs on a
highly diverse range of [computer
architectures](computer_architecture "wikilink"), including
[ARM](ARM_architecture_family "wikilink")-based Android smartphones and
the [IBM Z](IBM_Z "wikilink") mainframes. Specialized distributions and
kernel forks exist for less mainstream architectures; for example, the
[ELKS](Embeddable_Linux_Kernel_Subset "wikilink") kernel
[fork](<fork_(software_development)> "wikilink") can run on [Intel
8086](Intel_8086 "wikilink") or [Intel 80286](Intel_80286 "wikilink")
16-bit microprocessors, while the [µClinux](µClinux "wikilink") kernel
fork may run on systems without a [memory management
unit](memory_management_unit "wikilink"). The kernel also runs on
architectures that were only ever intended to use a proprietary
manufacturer-created operating system, such as
[Macintosh](Macintosh "wikilink") computers[97][98] (with
[PowerPC](PowerPC "wikilink"), [Intel](Intel "wikilink"), and [Apple
silicon](Apple_silicon "wikilink") processors),
[PDAs](Personal_digital_assistant "wikilink"), [video game
consoles](video_game_console "wikilink"), [portable music
players](Portable_media_player "wikilink"), and mobile phones.

Linux has a reputation for supporting old hardware very well by
maintaining standardized drivers for a long time.[99] There are several
industry associations and hardware
[conferences](<Convention_(meeting)> "wikilink") devoted to maintaining
and improving support for diverse hardware under Linux, such as
[FreedomHEC](FreedomHEC "wikilink"). Over time, support for different
hardware has improved in Linux, resulting in any off-the-shelf purchase
having a "good chance" of being compatible.[100]

In 2014, a new initiative was launched to automatically collect a
database of all tested hardware configurations.[101]

## Uses

## Market share and uptake

Many quantitative studies of free/open-source software focus on topics
including market share and reliability, with numerous studies
specifically examining Linux.[102] The Linux market is growing, and the
Linux operating system market size is expected to see a growth of 19.2%
by 2027, reaching $15.64 billion, compared to $3.89 billion in 2019.[103] Analysts project a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of
13.7% between 2024 and 2032, culminating in a market size of USD 34.90
billion by the latter year.[104] Analysts and proponents attribute the
relative success of Linux to its security, reliability, low cost, and
freedom from [vendor lock-in](vendor_lock-in "wikilink").[105][106]

Desktops and laptops  
According to [web server statistics](web_analytics "wikilink") (that is,
based on the numbers recorded from visits to websites by client
devices), , the estimated market share of Linux on [desktop
computers](desktop_computer "wikilink") is around 3.7%. In comparison,
[Microsoft Windows](Microsoft_Windows "wikilink") has a market share of
around 72.9%, while [macOS](macOS "wikilink") covers around 16.13%.[107]

<!-- -->

Web servers

<!-- -->

W3Cook publishes stats that use the top 1,000,000 Alexa domains,[108]
which estimate that 96.55% of web servers run Linux, 1.73% run Windows,
and 1.72% run FreeBSD.[109]

<!-- -->

W3Techs publishes stats that use the top 10,000,000 Alexa domains and
the top 1,000,000 Tranco domains, updated monthly[110] and estimate that
Linux is used by 39% of the web servers, versus 21.9% being used by
[Microsoft Windows](Microsoft_Windows "wikilink").[111] 40.1% used other
types of Unix.[112]

<!-- -->

[IDC](International_Data_Corporation "wikilink")'s Q1 2007 report
indicated that Linux held 12.7% of the overall server market at that
time;[113] this estimate was based on the number of Linux servers sold
by various companies, and did not include server hardware purchased
separately that had Linux installed on it later.

<!-- -->

Mobile devices  
Android, which is based on the Linux kernel, has become the dominant
operating system for smartphones. In April 2023, 68.61% of mobile
devices accessing websites using [StatCounter](StatCounter "wikilink")
were from Android.[114] Android is also a popular operating system for
tablets, being responsible for more than 60% of tablet sales .[115]
According to web server statistics, Android has a market share of about
71%, with [iOS](iOS "wikilink") holding 28%, and the remaining 1%
attributed to various niche platforms.[116]

<!-- -->

Film production  
For years, Linux has been the platform of choice in the film industry.
The first major film produced on Linux servers was 1997's
_[Titanic](<Titanic_(1997_film)> "wikilink")_.[117][118] Since then major
studios including [DreamWorks
Animation](DreamWorks_Animation "wikilink"), [Pixar](Pixar "wikilink"),
[Weta Digital](Weta_Digital "wikilink"), and [Industrial Light &
Magic](Industrial_Light_&_Magic "wikilink") have migrated to
Linux.[119][120][121] According to the Linux Movies Group, more than 95%
of the servers and desktops at large animation and visual effects
companies use Linux.[122]

<!-- -->

Use in government  
Linux distributions have also gained popularity with various local and
national governments. News of the Russian military creating its own
Linux distribution has also surfaced, and has come to fruition as the
G.H.ost Project.[123] The Indian state of [Kerala](Kerala "wikilink")
has gone to the extent of mandating that all state high schools run
Linux on their computers.[124][125]
[China](People's_Republic_of_China "wikilink") uses Linux exclusively as
the operating system for its [Loongson](Loongson "wikilink") processor
family to achieve technology independence.[126] In Spain, some regions
have developed their own Linux distributions, which are widely used in
education and official institutions, like gnuLinEx in Extremadura and
Guadalinex in Andalusia. [France](France "wikilink") and
[Germany](Germany "wikilink") have also taken steps toward the adoption
of Linux.[127] North Korea's [Red Star OS](Red_Star_OS "wikilink"),
developed , is based on a version of Fedora Linux.[128]

## Copyright, trademark, and naming

The Linux kernel is [licensed](software_license "wikilink") under the
GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2. The GPL requires that
anyone who distributes software based on source code under this license
must make the originating source code (and any modifications) available
to the recipient under the same terms.[129] Other key components of a
typical Linux distribution are also mainly licensed under the GPL, but
they may use other licenses; many libraries use the [GNU Lesser General
Public License](GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License "wikilink") (LGPL), a
more permissive variant of the GPL, and the
[X.Org](X.Org_Server "wikilink") implementation of the X Window System
uses the [MIT License](MIT_License "wikilink").

Torvalds states that the Linux kernel will not move from version 2 of
the GPL to version 3.[130][131] He specifically dislikes some provisions
in the new license which prohibit the use of the software in [digital
rights management](digital_rights_management "wikilink").[132] It would
also be impractical to obtain permission from all the copyright holders,
who number in the thousands.[133]

A 2001 study of [Red Hat Linux](Red_Hat_Linux "wikilink") 7.1 found that
this distribution contained 30 million [source lines of
code](source_lines_of_code "wikilink").[134] Using the [Constructive
Cost Model](COCOMO "wikilink"), the study estimated that this
distribution required about eight thousand person-years of development
time. According to the study, if all this software had been developed by
conventional proprietary means, it would have cost about to develop in
in the United States.[135] Most of the source code (71%) was written in
the C programming language, but many other languages were used,
including [C++](C++ "wikilink"),
[Lisp](<Lisp_(programming_language)> "wikilink"), assembly language, Perl,
Python, [Fortran](Fortran "wikilink"), and various [shell
scripting](shell_script "wikilink") languages. Slightly over half of all
lines of code were licensed under the GPL. The Linux kernel itself was
2.4 million lines of code, or 8% of the total.[136]

In a later study, the same analysis was performed for Debian version 4.0
(etch, which was released in 2007).[137] This distribution contained
close to 283 million source lines of code, and the study estimated that
it would have required about seventy three thousand man-years and cost
(in dollars) to develop by conventional means.

In the United States, the name _Linux_ is a trademark registered to
Linus Torvalds.[138] Initially, nobody registered it. However, on August
15, 1994, William R. Della Croce Jr. filed for the trademark _Linux_,
and then demanded royalties from Linux distributors. In 1996, Torvalds
and some affected organizations sued him to have the trademark assigned
to Torvalds, and, in 1997, the case was settled.[139] The licensing of
the trademark has since been handled by the [Linux Mark
Institute](Linux_Mark_Institute "wikilink") (LMI). Torvalds has stated
that he trademarked the name only to prevent someone else from using it.
LMI originally charged a nominal sublicensing fee for use of the Linux
name as part of trademarks,[140] but later changed this in favor of
offering a free, perpetual worldwide sublicense.[141]

The Free Software Foundation (FSF) prefers _GNU/Linux_ as the name when
referring to the operating system as a whole, because it considers Linux
distributions to be [variants](GNU_variants "wikilink") of the GNU
operating system initiated in 1983 by [Richard
Stallman](Richard_Stallman "wikilink"), president of the FSF.[142][143]
They explicitly take no issue over the name Android for the Android OS,
which is also an operating system based on the Linux kernel, as GNU is
not a part of it.

A minority of public figures and software projects other than Stallman
and the FSF, notably Debian (which had been sponsored by the FSF up to
1996),[144] also use _GNU/Linux_ when referring to the operating system
as a whole.[145][146][147] Most media and common usage, however, refers
to this family of operating systems simply as _Linux_, as do many large
Linux distributions (for example, [SUSE Linux](SUSE_Linux "wikilink")
and [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux "wikilink")). By
contrast, Linux distributions containing only free software use
"GNU/Linux" or simply "GNU", such as [Trisquel
GNU/Linux](Trisquel_GNU/Linux "wikilink"), [Parabola
GNU/Linux-libre](Parabola_GNU/Linux-libre "wikilink"), [BLAG Linux and
GNU](BLAG_Linux_and_GNU "wikilink"), and
[gNewSense](gNewSense "wikilink").

, about 8% to 13% of the [lines of
code](Source_lines_of_code "wikilink") of the Linux distribution Ubuntu
(version "Natty") is made of GNU components (the range depending on
whether GNOME is considered part of GNU); meanwhile, 6% is taken by the
Linux kernel, increased to 9% when including its direct
dependencies.[148]
