[[Ultrix]], and one of the required texts was ''[[Operating Systems: Design and
Implementation]]'' by [[Andrew S. Tanenbaum]]. This textbook included a copy of
Tanenbaum's [[MINIX]] operating system. It was with this course that Torvalds
first became exposed to Unix. In 1991, he became curious about operating
systems.&lt;ref>{{cite newsgroup | title = What would you like to see most in

the time limited it to educational use only,&lt;ref name="minix-lic" /> he began
to work on his operating system kernel, which eventually became the Linux
kernel. On July 3, 1991, to implement Unix [[system call]]s, Linus Torvalds
attempted unsuccessfully to obtain a digital copy of the [[POSIX]] standards
[[Software documentation|documentation]] with a request to the ''comp.os.minix''
[[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroup]].&lt;ref>{{cite book |last1=Torvalds |first1=Linus

not finding the POSIX documentation, Torvalds initially resorted to determining
system calls from [[SunOS]] documentation owned by the university for use in
operating its [[Sun Microsystems]] server. He also learned some system calls
from Tanenbaum's MINIX text. Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel
on MINIX and applications written for MINIX were also used on Linux. Later,
Linux matured and further Linux kernel development took place on Linux
systems.&lt;ref>{{cite newsgroup|title=Chicken and egg: How was the first linux

GNU applications also replaced all MINIX components, because it was advantageous
to use the freely available code from the GNU Project with the fledgling
operating system; code licensed under the GNU GPL can be reused in other
computer programs as long as they also are released under the same or a
compatible license. Torvalds initiated a switch from his original license, which
prohibited commercial redistribution, to the GNU GPL.&lt;ref>{{cite web

[[File:Linux 0 12.jpg|thumb|5.25-inch [[floppy disk]]s holding a very early
version of Linux]] Linus Torvalds had wanted to call his invention
"'''Freax'''", a [[portmanteau]] of "free", "freak", and "x" (as an allusion to
Unix). During the start of his work on the system, some of the project's
[[makefile]]s included the name "Freax" for about half a year. Initially,
Torvalds considered the name "Linux" but dismissed it as too egotistical.&lt;ref
name="fun">Torvalds, Linus and Diamond, David, ''Just for Fun: The Story of an
Accidental Revolutionary'', 2001, {{ISBN|0-06-662072-4}}&lt;/ref> To facilitate
development, the files were uploaded to the [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP
server]] (&lt;code>ftp.funet.fi&lt;/code>) of [[FUNET]] in September 1991. Ari
Lemmke, Torvalds' coworker at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] (HUT)
who was one of the volunteer administrators for the FTP server at the time, did
not think that "Freax" was a good name, so he named the project "Linux" on the
server without consulting Torvalds.&lt;ref name="fun" /> Later, however,
Torvalds consented to "Linux". According to a [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroup]]
post by Torvalds,&lt;ref name="pronunciation-2"/> the word "Linux" should be
pronounced ({{IPAc-en|audio=Linus-linux.ogg|ˈ|l|ɪ|n|ʊ|k|s}}
{{respell|LIN|uuks}}) with a short 'i' as in 'print' and 'u' as in 'put'. To
further demonstrate how the word "Linux" should be pronounced, he included an
audio guide with the kernel source code.&lt;ref name="Pronounce">{{cite web|url

[[bootloader]], for example [[GNU GRUB]], [[LILO (bootloader)|LILO]],
[[SYSLINUX]] or [[systemd-boot]]. This is a program that loads the Linux kernel
into the computer's [[main memory]], by being executed by the computer when it
is turned on and after the [[firmware]] initialization is performed. * An
[[init]] program, such as the traditional [[sysvinit]] and the newer
[[systemd]], [[OpenRC]] and [[Upstart (software)|Upstart]]. This is the first
[[Process (computing)|process]] launched by the Linux kernel, and is at the root
of the process tree. It starts processes such as system services and login
prompts (whether graphical or in terminal mode). * [[Library
(computing)|Software libraries]], which contain code that can be used by running
processes. On Linux systems using [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]]-format
executable files, the [[dynamic linker]] that manages the use of dynamic
libraries is known as [[ld-linux.so]]. If the system is set up for the user to
compile software themselves, [[header file]]s will also be included to describe
the [[API|programming interface]] of installed libraries. Besides the most
commonly used software library on Linux systems, the [[GNU C Library]] (glibc),
there are numerous other libraries, such as [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] and
[[Mesa (computer graphics)|Mesa]]. ** The [[C standard library]] is the library
necessary to run programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]] on a
computer system, with the GNU C Library being the standard. It provides an
implementation of the POSIX API, as well as extensions to that API. For embedded
systems, alternatives such as [[musl]], [[EGLIBC]] (a glibc fork once used by
Debian) and [[uClibc]] (which was designed for [[uClinux]]) have been developed,
although the last two are no longer maintained. Android uses its own C library,
[[Bionic (software)|Bionic]]. However, musl can additionally be used as a
replacement for glibc on desktop and laptop systems, as seen on certain Linux
distributions like [[Void Linux]]. * Basic Unix commands, with GNU coreutils
being the standard implementation. Alternatives exist for embedded systems, such
as the copyleft [[BusyBox]], and the BSD-licensed [[Toybox]]. * [[Widget
toolkit]]s are the libraries used to build [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs)
for software applications. Numerous widget toolkits are available, including
[[GTK]] and [[Clutter (software)|Clutter]] developed by the [[GNOME Project]],
[[Qt (software)|Qt]] developed by the [[Qt Project]] and led by [[The Qt
Company]], and [[Enlightenment Foundation Libraries]] (EFL) developed primarily
by the [[Enlightenment (software)|Enlightenment]] team. * A [[package
manager|package management system]], such as [[dpkg]] and [[RPM Package
Manager|RPM]]. Alternatively packages can be compiled from binary or source
[[Tar (computing)|tarballs]]. * User interface programs such as command shells
or windowing environments. === User interface === The [[user interface]], also
known as the [[shell (computing)|shell]], is either a command-line interface
(CLI), a graphical user interface (GUI), or controls attached to the associated
hardware, which is common for embedded systems. For desktop systems, the default
user interface is usually graphical, although the CLI is commonly available
through [[terminal emulator]] windows or on a separate [[virtual console]]. CLI
shells are text-based user interfaces, which use text for both input and output.
The dominant shell used in Linux is the [[bash (Unix shell)|Bourne-Again Shell]]
(bash), originally developed for the GNU Project. Most low-level Linux
components, including various parts of the [[Userland (computing)|userland]],
use the CLI exclusively. The CLI is particularly suited for automation of
repetitive or delayed tasks and provides very simple [[inter-process
communication]]. On desktop systems, the most popular user interfaces are the
[[GUI shell]]s, packaged together with extensive desktop environments, such as
[[KDE Plasma 5|KDE Plasma]], [[GNOME]], [[MATE (desktop environment)|MATE]],
[[Cinnamon (desktop environment)|Cinnamon]], [[LXDE]], [[Elementary
OS|Pantheon]], and [[Xfce]], though a variety of additional user interfaces
exist. Most popular user interfaces are based on the X Window System, often
simply called "X". It provides [[network transparency]] and permits a graphical
application running on one system to be displayed on another where a user may
interact with the application; however, certain extensions of the X Window
System are not capable of working over the network.&lt;ref>{{cite web |url =

servers exist, with the reference implementation, [[X.Org Server]], being the
most popular. Server distributions might provide a command-line interface for
developers and administrators, but provide a custom interface for end-users,
designed for the use case of the system. This custom interface is accessed
through a client that resides on another system, not necessarily Linux-based.
Several types of [[window manager]]s exist for X11, including [[Tiling window
manager|tiling]], [[Dynamic window manager|dynamic]], [[stacking window
manager|stacking]], and [[compositing window manager|compositing]]. Window
managers provide means to control the placement and appearance of individual
application windows, and interact with the X Window System. Simpler [[X window
manager]]s such as [[dwm]], [[ratpoison]], or [[i3 (window manager)|i3wm]]
provide a [[Minimalism (computing)|minimalist]] functionality, while more
elaborate window managers such as [[FVWM]], [[Enlightenment
(software)|Enlightenment]], or [[Window Maker]] provide more features such as a
built-in [[taskbar]] and [[theme (computing)|themes]], but are still lightweight
when compared to desktop environments. Desktop environments include window
managers as part of their standard installations, such as [[Mutter
(software)|Mutter]] (GNOME), [[KWin]] (KDE), or [[Xfwm]] (xfce), although users
may choose to use a different window manager if preferred. Wayland is a display
server protocol intended as a replacement for the X11 protocol; {{As
of|2022|lc=yes}}, it has received relatively wide adoption.&lt;ref>{{Cite web |

window manager and compositing manager. Therefore, a Wayland compositor takes
the role of the display server, window manager, and compositing manager. Weston
is the reference implementation of Wayland, while GNOME's Mutter and KDE's KWin
are being ported to Wayland as standalone display servers. Enlightenment has
already been successfully ported since version 19.&lt;ref>{{Cite

software projects, although developed through [[collaboration]], are often
produced independently of each other. The fact that the software licenses
explicitly permit redistribution, however, provides a basis for larger-scale
projects that collect the software produced by stand-alone projects and make it
available all at once in the form of a Linux distribution. Many Linux
distributions manage a remote collection of system software and application
software packages available for download and installation through a network
connection. This allows users to adapt the operating system to their specific
needs. Distributions are maintained by individuals, loose-knit teams, volunteer
organizations, and commercial entities. A distribution is responsible for the
default configuration of the installed Linux kernel, general system security,
and more generally integration of the different software packages into a
coherent whole. Distributions typically use a package manager such as [[APT
(software)|apt]], [[yum (software)|yum]], [[ZYpp|zypper]], [[Pacman (package
manager)|pacman]] or [[Portage (software)|portage]] to install, remove, and
update all of a system's software from one central location.&lt;ref>{{Cite

=== Community === {{See also|Free software movement|Linux user group}} A
distribution is largely driven by its developer and user communities. Some
vendors develop and fund their distributions on a volunteer basis, [[Debian]]

In many cities and regions, local associations known as [[Linux User Group]]s
(LUGs) seek to promote their preferred distribution and by extension free
software. They hold meetings and provide free demonstrations, training,
technical support, and operating system installation to new users. Many Internet
communities also provide support to Linux users and developers. Most
distributions and free software / open-source projects have [[Internet Relay
Chat|IRC]] chatrooms or [[newsgroup]]s. [[Internet forum|Online forums]] are
another means of support, with notable examples being [[LinuxQuestions.org]] and
the various distribution-specific support and community forums, such as ones for
[[Ubuntu]], Fedora, and [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]]. Linux distributions host
[[mailing list]]s; commonly there will be a specific topic such as usage or
development for a given list. There are several technology websites with a Linux
focus. Print magazines on Linux often bundle [[cover disk]]s that carry software
or even complete Linux distributions.&lt;ref>{{cite web |

distributions are generally available without charge, several large corporations
sell, support, and contribute to the development of the components of the system
and free software. An analysis of the Linux kernel in 2017 showed that well over
85% of the code was developed by programmers who are being paid for their work,
leaving about 8.2% to unpaid developers and 4.1% unclassified.&lt;ref name =

Some of the major corporations that provide contributions include [[Intel]],
[[Samsung]], [[Google]], [[AMD]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], and
[[Facebook]].&lt;ref name="Linux Foundation 2021-11-14" /> Several corporations,
notably Red Hat, [[Canonical (company)|Canonical]], and [[SUSE S.A.|SUSE]] have
built a significant business around Linux distributions. The [[free software
license]]s, on which the various software packages of a distribution built on
the Linux kernel are based, explicitly accommodate and encourage
commercialization; the relationship between a Linux distribution as a whole and
individual vendors may be seen as [[symbiosis|symbiotic]]. One common [[business
model]] of commercial suppliers is charging for support, especially for business
users. A number of companies also offer a specialized business version of their
distribution, which adds proprietary support packages and tools to administer
higher numbers of installations or to simplify administrative tasks. Another
business model is to give away the software to sell hardware. This used to be
the norm in the computer industry, with operating systems such as [[CP/M]],
[[Apple DOS]], and versions of the [[classic Mac OS]] before 7.6 freely copyable
(but not modifiable). As computer hardware standardized throughout the 1980s, it
became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this tactic, as
the OS would run on any manufacturer's computer that shared the same
architecture. === Programming on Linux === Most [[programming language]]s
support Linux either directly or through third-party community based
[[Porting|ports]].&lt;ref>{{cite web |url=https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran

Many programming languages have a cross-platform reference implementation that
supports Linux, for example [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Ruby (programming

[[Lazarus (software)|Lazarus]], [[PascalABC.NET]], or [[Delphi

A common feature of Unix-like systems, Linux includes traditional
specific-purpose programming languages targeted at [[scripting
language|scripting]], text processing and system configuration and management in
general. Linux distributions support [[shell script]]s, [[AWK|awk]], [[sed]] and
[[make (software)|make]]. Many programs also have an embedded programming
language to support configuring or programming themselves. For example,
[[regular expression]]s are supported in programs like [[grep]] and [[locate
(Unix)|locate]], the traditional Unix message transfer agent [[Sendmail]]
contains its own [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]] scripting system, and
the advanced text editor [[GNU Emacs]] is built around a general purpose [[Emacs
Lisp|Lisp]] interpreter. Most distributions also include support for [[PHP]],
[[Perl]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Python (programming
language)|Python]] and other [[dynamic programming language|dynamic languages]].
While not as common, Linux also supports [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]
and other [[Common Language Infrastructure|CLI]] [[List of CLI

like [[Kaffe]] and [[Jikes RVM]]; [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]],
[[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Apache Groovy|Groovy]] and other
[[List of JVM languages|JVM languages]] are also available. GNOME and [[KDE]]
are popular desktop environments and provide a framework for developing
applications. These projects are based on the [[GTK]] and [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]]

Initially, nobody registered it. However, on August 15, 1994, William R. Della

Linux distributors. In 1996, Torvalds and some affected organizations sued him
to have the trademark assigned to Torvalds, and, in 1997, the case was

simply "GNU", such as [[Trisquel GNU/Linux]], [[Parabola GNU/Linux-libre]],
[[BLAG Linux and GNU]], and [[gNewSense]]. {{As of|2011|May}}, about 8% to 13%
of the [[Source lines of code|lines of code]] of the Linux distribution Ubuntu
