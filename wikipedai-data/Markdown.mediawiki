'''Markdown'''<ref name="philosophy" /> is a [[lightweight markup language]] for creating [[formatted text]] using a [[text editor|plain-text editor]]. [[John Gruber]] and [[Aaron Swartz]]<ref name="Hendler 2022" /><ref name="PeerJ 2017" /> created Markdown in 2004 as a [[markup language]] that is intended to be easy to read in its source code form.<ref name="philosophy" /> Markdown is widely used for [[blog]]ging and [[instant messaging]], and also used elsewhere in [[online forums]], [[collaborative software]], [[documentation]] pages, and [[README|readme files]].

The initial description of Markdown<ref>{{Cite web|title=Daring Fireball: Introducing Markdown|url=https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/introducing_markdown|access-date=2020-09-23|website=daringfireball.net|archive-date=2020-09-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200920182442/https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/introducing_markdown|url-status=live}}</ref> contained ambiguities and raised unanswered questions, causing implementations to both intentionally and accidentally diverge from the original version. This was addressed in 2014 when long-standing Markdown contributors released [[#Standardization|CommonMark]], an unambiguous specification and test suite for Markdown.<ref name="FutureOfMarkdown" />

== History ==
Markdown was inspired by pre-existing [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] for marking up [[plain text]] in [[email]] and [[usenet]] posts, such as the earlier markup languages [[setext]] ({{Circa|1992}}), [[Textile (markup language)|Textile]] (c. 2002), and [[reStructuredText]] (c. 2002).<ref name="philosophy" />

In 2002 [[Aaron Swartz]] created [[atx (markup language)|atx]] and referred to it as "the true structured text format". Gruber and Swartz<ref name="Hendler 2022" /><ref name="PeerJ 2017" /> created the Markdown language in 2004, with the goal of enabling people "to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, optionally convert it to structurally valid [[XHTML]] (or [[HTML]])."<ref name="md">Markdown 1.0.1 readme source code {{cite web|url=http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ |title=Daring Fireball – Markdown |date=2004-12-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040402182332/http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ |archive-date=2004-04-02 }}</ref>

Its key design goal was ''readability'', that the language be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions,{{r|name="philosophy"|reference=Markdown Syntax {{cite web|url=http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy|title=Daring Fireball – Markdown – Syntax|date=2013-06-13 }} "Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown's syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters — including Setext, atx, Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext{{r |name="grutatext" |reference={{Cite web |title=Un naufragio personal: The Grutatxt markup |url=https://triptico.com/docs/grutatxt_markup.html |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=triptico.com }} }}, and EtText{{r |name="ettext" |reference={{Cite web |title=EtText: Documentation: Using EtText |url=http://ettext.taint.org/doc/ettext.html |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=ettext.taint.org}} }} — the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text email." }} unlike text formatted with 'heavier' [[markup language]]s, such as [[Rich Text Format]] (RTF), HTML, or even [[wikitext]] (each of which have obvious in-line tags and formatting instructions which can make the text more difficult for humans to read).

Gruber wrote a [[Perl]] script, {{code|Markdown.pl}}, which converts marked-up text input to valid, [[XML#Well-formedness and error-handling|well-formed]] XHTML or HTML and replaces angle brackets ({{code|<}}, {{code|>}}) and [[ampersand]]s ({{code|&}}) with their corresponding [[character entity references]]. It can take the role of a standalone script,  a plugin for [[Blosxom]] or a [[Movable Type]], or of a text filter for [[BBEdit]].<ref name="md" />

== Rise and divergence ==
As Markdown's popularity grew rapidly, many Markdown implementations appeared, driven mostly by the need for additional features such as tables, footnotes, definition lists,<ref group="note">Technically HTML description lists</ref> and Markdown inside HTML blocks.

The behavior of some of these diverged from the reference implementation, as Markdown was only characterised by an informal specification<ref>{{cite web|url=https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax|title=Markdown Syntax Documentation|publisher=Daring Fireball|access-date=2018-03-09|archive-date=2019-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909051956/https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax|url-status=live}}</ref> and a Perl implementation for conversion to HTML.

At the same time, a number of ambiguities in the informal specification had attracted attention.<ref name="gfm_on_github-why_spec">{{cite web|url=https://github.github.com/gfm/#why-is-a-spec-needed-|title=GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec – Why is a spec needed?|website=github.github.com|access-date=2018-05-17|archive-date=2020-02-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203204734/https://github.github.com/gfm/#why-is-a-spec-needed-|url-status=live}}</ref>  These issues spurred the creation of tools such as Babelmark<ref name="babelmark-2">{{cite web |url=http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/ |title=Babelmark 2 – Compare markdown implementations |publisher=Johnmacfarlane.net |access-date=2014-04-25 |archive-date=2017-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718113552/http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="babelmark-3">{{cite web |url=https://babelmark.github.io/ |title=Babelmark 3 – Compare Markdown Implementations |publisher=github.io |access-date=2017-12-10 |archive-date=2020-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112043521/https://babelmark.github.io/ |url-status=live }}</ref> to compare the output of various implementations,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/faq.html |title=Babelmark 2 – FAQ |publisher=Johnmacfarlane.net |access-date=2014-04-25 |archive-date=2017-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728115918/http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/faq.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and an effort by some developers of Markdown parsers for standardisation. However, Gruber has argued that complete standardization would be a mistake: "Different sites (and people) have different needs. No one syntax would make all happy."<ref>{{cite tweet|user=gruber|author-link=John Gruber|first=John|last=Gruber|number=507670720886091776|date=4 September 2014|title=@tobie @espadrine @comex @wycats Because different sites (and people) have different needs. No one syntax would make all happy.}}</ref>

Gruber avoided using curly braces in Markdown to unofficially reserve them for implementation-specific extensions.<ref name="curlyBraces">{{cite web |url=https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/05/19/markdoc |title=Markdoc |last=Gruber |first=John |date=19 May 2022 |website=Daring Fireball |access-date=May 19, 2022 |quote=I love their syntax extensions — very true to the spirit of Markdown. They use curly braces for their extensions; I'm not sure I ever made this clear, publicly, but I avoided using curly braces in Markdown itself — even though they are very tempting characters — to unofficially reserve them for implementation-specific extensions. Markdoc's extensive use of curly braces for its syntax is exactly the sort of thing I was thinking about. |archive-date=19 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220519202920/https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/05/19/markdoc |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== GitHub Flavored Markdown ===
<!-- linked from redirect [[GitHub Flavored Markdown]] -->
GitHub had been using its own variant of Markdown since as early as 2009,<ref>{{cite web |title = GitHub Flavored Markdown Examples |author = [[Tom Preston-Werner]] |url = https://github.com/mojombo/github-flavored-markdown/issues/1 |website = GitHub |accessdate = 2021-04-02 |archive-date = 2021-05-13 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210513154115/https://github.com/mojombo/github-flavored-markdown/issues/1 |url-status = live }}</ref> which added support for additional formatting such as tables and nesting [[HTML element#Block elements|block content]] inside list elements, as well as GitHub-specific features such as auto-linking references to commits, issues, usernames, etc. In 2017, GitHub released a formal specification of its GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) that is based on CommonMark.<ref name="gfm_on_github" /> It is a [[Superset|strict superset]] of CommonMark, following its specification exactly except for ''tables, strikethrough, autolinks and task lists,'' which GFM adds as extensions.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://githubengineering.com/a-formal-spec-for-github-markdown/ |title = A formal spec for GitHub Flavored Markdown |website = GitHub Engineering |date = 14 March 2017 |access-date = 16 Mar 2017 |archive-date = 3 February 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200203205138/https://githubengineering.com/a-formal-spec-for-github-markdown/ |url-status = live }}</ref> Accordingly, GitHub also changed the parser used on their sites, which required that some documents be changed. For instance, GFM now requires that the [[number sign|hash symbol]] that creates a heading be separated from the heading text by a space character.

== Implementations ==
Implementations of Markdown are available for over a dozen [[programming language]]s; in addition, many applications, platforms and [[Software framework|frameworks]] support Markdown.<ref>{{cite web|title=W3C Community Page of Markdown Implementations|url=https://www.w3.org/community/markdown/wiki/MarkdownImplementations|website=W3C Markdown Wiki|access-date=24 March 2016|archive-date=17 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200917231621/https://www.w3.org/community/markdown/wiki/MarkdownImplementations|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, Markdown [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]] exist for every major [[blog]]ging platform.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/10/markdown-throwdown-what-happens-when-foss-software-gets-corporate-backing/ | date=2014-10-05 | title=Markdown THrowdown – What happens when FOSS software gets corporate backing | publisher=Ars Technica | access-date=2017-06-14 | archive-date=2020-11-14 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114231130/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/10/markdown-throwdown-what-happens-when-foss-software-gets-corporate-backing/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

While Markdown is a minimal markup language and is read and edited with a normal [[text editor]], there are specially designed editors that preview the files with styles, which are available for all major platforms. Many general-purpose text and [[Source-code editor|code editors]] have [[syntax highlighting]] plugins for Markdown built into them or available as optional download. Editors may feature a side-by-side preview window or render the code directly in a [[WYSIWYG]] fashion.

Some apps, services and editors support Markdown as an editing format, including:

* [[Bugzilla]] uses a customized version of Markdown.<ref>{{Cite web |title=330707 - Add optional support for MarkDown |url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=330707 |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=bugzilla.mozilla.org |language=en |archive-date=2022-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221011143200/https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=330707 |url-status=live }}</ref>
* [[ChatGPT]]: Output from the AI model formatted in Markdown will be rendered in LaTeX and HTML by the ChatGPT client, and the model is encouraged to use Markdown to format its output. Markdown provided by the user will not be formatted by the client, but will still be passed to the AI model unaltered.
