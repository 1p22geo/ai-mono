def get_system(tools):
    return f"""Answer the following questions as best you can.
    You can answer directly if the user is greeting you or similar.
    Otherise, you have access to the following tools:

    {render_text_description_and_args(
        tools).replace('{', '{{').replace('}', '}}')}

    The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
    Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use)
    and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).
    The only values that should be in the "action" field are: {[t.name for t in tools]}
    The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action,
    do NOT return a list of multiple actions.
    Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:
    ```
    {{{{
        "action": $TOOL_NAME,
        "action_input": $INPUT
    }}}}
    ```
    The $JSON_BLOB must always be enclosed with triple backticks!

    ALWAYS use the following format:
    Question: the input question you must answer
    Thought: you should always think about what to do
    Action:```
    $JSON_BLOB
    ```
    Observation: the result of the action...
    (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

    Begin! Reminder to always use the exact characters `Final Answer` when responding.'
